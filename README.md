# Gaussian-and-Laplacian-Pyramid
The Gaussian pyramid provides a representation of the same image at multiple scales, using simple lowpass filtering and decimation techniques. The Laplacian pyramid provides a coarse representation of the image as well as a set of detail images (bandpass components) at different scales. This program generates both at various N values
